# Practice: Express Server
## In this exercise, a server using Node and Express are created.  
The server passes simple responses to the browser based upon the web address.

Learning Objectives:
- how to initialize a server
- how to use express methods to create a new page
- how to respond to the browser with html elements
- how to use the request from the browser (req.params) to influence the response

This repo is a sample of how to set up folders and js for later projects.
