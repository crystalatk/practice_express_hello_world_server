# Practice: Express Server
## In this exercise, I create a server using Node and Express.  
The server passes simple responses to the browser based upon the web address.

What I learned:
- how to initialize a server
- how to use express methods to create a new page
- how to respond to the browser with html elements
- how to use the request from the browser (req.params) to influence the response

This repo is a sample of how I want to set up folders and js for my next projects.

I still have more to learn about using templates and integrating this with a front-end.
